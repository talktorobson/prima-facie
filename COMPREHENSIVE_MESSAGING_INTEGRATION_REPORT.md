## 🏗️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE ASSESSMENT

### **Integration Status by Component**

| Component | Status | Integration Level | Issues |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **Authentication** | 🟡 Good | 75% | Route protection inconsistencies |
| **Messaging Core** | 🔴 Poor | 37.5% | UI components not accessible |
| **Client Portal** | 🟠 Fair | 50% | Action buttons non-functional |
| **Cross-System Nav** | 🟢 Good | 81.8% | Billing system blocked |
| **Performance** | 🟢 Excellent | 100% | No issues detected |
| **Business Logic** | 🟡 Good | 80% | Client access restrictions |

### **Real-Time Features Assessment**
The testing revealed that while the real-time infrastructure appears to be in place, the actual messaging interface components are not properly accessible through automated testing, suggesting potential issues with:
- Component rendering
- Event handling
- UI accessibility
- Real-time service initialization

### **Multi-User Scenarios**
Testing was limited due to interface accessibility issues, but the foundation appears sound:
- Authentication properly segregates users
- Role-based access controls mostly functional
- Cross-user communication pathways established
