node apply-seed-data.js

# Verify seed data application
node verify-seed-data.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Missing required tables"** ‚Üí Apply database migration first
2. **"Table does not exist"** ‚Üí Optional billing tables, continue with core seeding
3. **"Permission denied"** ‚Üí Ensure service role key is configured
4. **"Duplicate key"** ‚Üí Seed data already applied, safe to ignore

### Cleanup (if needed)
To reset seed data:
```sql
-- Remove all seed data (keep structure)
DELETE FROM invoice_line_items;
DELETE FROM invoices;
DELETE FROM time_entries;
DELETE FROM matter_contacts;
DELETE FROM matters;
DELETE FROM contacts WHERE law_firm_id IN ('123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000', '234e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174001');
-- Continue for other tables...
```

## Support
The seed data is designed to be:
- **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times
- **Realistic**: Based on actual Brazilian legal practice
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all major application features
- **Consistent**: Maintains referential integrity

For issues, verify database migration status first, then check table-specific errors in the SQL output.
